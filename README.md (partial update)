# Product Image Export for Odoo

This module extends Odoo's product export functionality to include image URLs when exporting products to Excel or CSV.

## Features

- Adds an `image_url` field to products
- Automatically computes public URLs for product images
- Includes image URLs in Excel and CSV exports

## Installation

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

This repository includes Docker configuration for easy development and testing:

1. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product_image_export.git
   cd product_image_export
   ```

3. Make the development script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/docker_dev.sh
   ```

4. Start the development environment:

   ```bash
   ./odoo-tools start
   ```

5. Access Odoo at http://localhost:8069

   - Create a new database
   - Install the "Product Image Export" module from the Apps menu

6. For development:
   - View logs: `./docker_dev.sh logs`
   - Restart services: `./docker_dev.sh restart`
   - Access container shell: `./docker_dev.sh shell`

### Option 2: Development Environment Setup with Poetry

1. Install Poetry:

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product_image_export.git
   cd product_image_export
   ```

3. Create a Poetry virtual environment without installing Odoo as a dependency:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. Link your local Odoo installation by either:

   a. Adding your Odoo directory to PYTHONPATH:

   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/odoo:$PYTHONPATH"
   ```

   b. Or creating a symlink to Odoo in your virtual environment:

   ```bash
   cd $(poetry env info -p)/lib/python3.X/site-packages/
   ln -s /path/to/odoo odoo
   ```

### Odoo Installation

For this module to work, you need to have Odoo 16.0 installed. You can:

1. Use official Docker images:

   ```bash
   docker pull odoo:16.0
   ```

2. Or clone from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git -b 16.0 --depth=1
   ```

## Usage

1. Start Odoo with the module in your addons path.
2. Go to Sales > Products or Inventory > Products.
3. Select the products you want to export.
4. Click the "Export" button.
5. Select Excel or CSV format.
6. Make sure "image_url" is included in the list of fields to export.
7. Click "Export" to download your file.

The exported file will now include a column with the public URL for each product's image.

## Technical Notes

- The module computes image URLs based on the Odoo attachment system
- By default, the URLs require Odoo authentication to access
- You can make individual product image URLs publicly accessible by:
  1. Editing the product
  2. Checking the "Public Image URL" option
  3. Saving the product

### Security Considerations

When making product image URLs public:

- Anyone with the URL can access the image, even without logging into Odoo
- This is useful for embedding in external systems or sharing with partners
- Consider the sensitivity of your product images before making them public

## Compatibility

- Odoo 16.0
- Compatible with Community and Enterprise editions

## Deployment

### Remote Server Deployment

This module includes a deployment system using Dokploy that allows you to easily deploy to a remote server:

1. Configure your deployment environment:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your server details
   ```

2. Deploy to your remote server:

   ```bash
   ./odoo-tools deploy
   ```

   Or run a dry-run deployment first:

   ```bash
   ./odoo-tools deploy-dry
   ```

3. Deploy with interactive prompts:

   ```bash
   ./odoo-tools deploy --interactive
   ```

The deployment script will:
- Copy the module files to your remote server
- Set proper ownership permissions
- Update the module in Odoo

### Requirements for Deployment

- SSH access to your remote server
- Dokploy installed (`pip install dokploy`)
- Odoo running on your remote server
